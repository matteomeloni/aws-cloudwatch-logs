Contributions are accepted via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/matteomeloni/aws-cloudwatch-logs).

## Pull Requests

- Please make sure your code follows the PSR-2 coding standard and the PSR-4 autoloading standard before sending a pull request.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `readme.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

**Happy coding**!
